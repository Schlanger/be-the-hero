  ## âš™ How to use:



First of all, after downloading the file, you need to run the back-end, to do this open your terminal and navigate to your back-end and execute the following commands:

```bash
# this command install all dependencies
$ yarn install

#start back-end
$ yarn start
```

To run the front-end, open your terminal and navigate to your front-end and execute the following commands:

```bash
# this command install all dependencies
$ yarn install

#start front-end
$ yarn start
```

After that procedure you should automatically open the browser with the application running. If this does not happen and is running normally, go to a browser and put: "localhost: 3000" and press enter.



For mobile open your terminal and navigate to the mobile folder. After that, execute the following commands:

```bash
# this command install all dependencies
